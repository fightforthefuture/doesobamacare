            <h3>Our Scoring System </h3>

            <p>This project originated in a desire to update EFF's
                <a href="https://standagainstspying.org/">"Stand Against
                    Spying"</a> scorecard covering legislative activity in the
                113th Congress (2013-14), to take into account votes taken in
                the legislative battle over Section 215 renewal and the USA
                FREEDOM Act, which provided limited reforms of Section 215. It
                is a joint project of Restore The Fourth and Fight for the
                Future, with the key participants being Alex Marthews and Zaki
                Manian of Restore The Fourth and Tiffiniy Cheng and Jeff Lyon of
                Fight for the Future.
            </p>

            <p>
                We decided early on that, like with "Stand Against Spying", the
                scorecard should be objective: That is, it should not contain
                value judgments about the quality or trustworthiness of
                legislators' public statements on mass surveillance, or about
                how the legislator was generally perceived to stand on that
                issue, but should consider only the votes they actually took,
                and decisions to sponsor or cosponsor legislation introduced in
                Congress. This important limitation means that, for example,
                House Majority Leader John Boehner, who has a general practice
                of not voting on bills unless he has to to break a tie, does not
                have a score in our scorecard and is therefore graded at "?",
                despite voluminous press reports suggesting that he is generally
                opposed to surveillance reform; and that Curtis Clawson (R-FL)
                and Ruben Hinojosa (D-FL), whose voting records are too sparse
                on this topic to enable a clear judgement to be made, are also
                graded at ?.
            </p>

            <p>The major challenge for a surveillance scorecard is interpreting
                votes on the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015. Being against this Act was
                not a clear signal of being for or against surveillance reform.
                For many organizations, including ours, and for many legislators
                as well, the USA FREEDOM Act was far too weak and limited to
                represent any kind of surveillance reform, and also modernized
                certain powers of the surveillance state. Its passage even posed
                a risk of derailing real surveillance reform by enabling
                legislators to make the political claim that it had dealt with
                the problem of mass surveillance. A Yes vote on the USA FREEDOM
                Act could therefore potentially mean that the legislator thought
                that it was a good, if incremental, step towards reform; but it
                could also, as it turned it for some legislators, be thought of
                as the most feasible way to preserve surveillance authorities
                against the threat of the outright expiration of Section 215. A
                No vote could mean that the legislator thought the USA FREEDOM
                Act didn't go nearly far enough; but it could also mean that the
                legislator could not accept even its very weak reforms, and felt
                that Congress should not restrict surveillance authorities at
                all.
            </p>

            <p>In consequence, we needed some objective indicator of a
                legislator's underlying desire for surveillance reform, in order
                to assign points correctly to their votes on the USA FREEDOM
                Act. For the Senate, we found an indicator, in the form of the
                Senate's vote on whether to do "straight reauthorization" of
                Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. If a Senator voted Yes on
                straight reauthorization, that was a much clearer indicator that
                they wanted no surveillance reform whatsoever, and therefore
                that if they then voted No on the USA FREEDOM Act, it was
                because they believed it went too far. Conversely, a Senator
                voting No on straight reauthorization and then No on the USA
                FREEDOM Act likely felt that the USA FREEDOM Act was far too
                weak. For the former group, we coded a No vote on USA FREEDOM as
                -4 points; for the latter group, we coded the same vote as +4
                points. In the House, we went back to EFF's "Stand Against
                Spying" scorecard and analyzed the grades of the 88 House
                members voting against the USA FREEDOM Act, and found that in
                almost all cases their grades on that prior scorecard were very
                high. Consequently, we felt comfortable coding all House No
                votes on USA FREEDOM as +4. After much discussion, we felt that
                most legislators voting Yes on USA FREEDOM in either chamber
                probably voted Yes because they felt it was a positive step
                towards reform, so we coded such votes as +1.
            </p>

            <p>For the prior votes on the 2014 version of USA FREEDOM, we
                adopted EFF's approach, and scored the version before it was
                gutted at +2 and the version after it was gutted at -2.
            </p>

            <p>The rest of the coding was relatively straightforward. Voting for
                or cosponsoring measures that advanced surveillance reform
                gained points for the legislator; voting against such measures,
                or cosponsoring anti-reform measures, lost points for the
                legislator. The number of points gained or lost represents our
                collective value judgement as to how much the measure, if
                passed, would advance the overall project of surveillance
                reform. For example, the wholesale repeal of the surveillance
                state represented by the Surveillance State Repeal Acts of 2014
                and 2015 merit four points each; the FISA Reform Act of 2015,
                briefly introduced as an attempt to provide a weaker substitute
                for the USA FREEDOM Act, merits -3 points.
            </p>

            <p>Summary of Points Allocation</p>

            <p> As further relevant votes come up, such as those on CISA, we
                will add them to our points system. At the beginning of the
                116th Congress, we intend to remove the point allocations for
                the 113th Congress, to keep the scorecard relevant to
                legislators' recent activity.
            </p>

            <p>113th Congress (2013-14):</p>

            <p>Implications of the Scorecard</p>

            <p>This project threw up several important findings relevant to
                journalists reporting on surveillance, and to members of the
                public deciding how to vote and whom to fund.</p>

            <p>First, and most importantly, party affiliation is not a guide to
                your legislator's stance on mass surveillance. Unlike for almost
                any other issue, both support for and opposition to surveillance
                reform crosses party lines. Strongly liberal legislators usually
                get A+ (as with Rep. Barbara Lee or Sen. Bernie Sanders) or As,
                but Charlie Rangel gets only a B+, and there are two Democrats,
                Jim Langevin of Rhode Island and Terri Sewell of Alabama, who
                get Fs. While strongly conservative legislators do most often
                get Ds and Fs, there are conservatives not closely identified in
                public with the surveillance reform fight, like Louie Gohmert of
                Texas and Jeff Duncan of South Carolina, who get A+. So while
                not entirely useless, party affiliation is highly unreliable,
                and journalists should steer clear of identifying a party-based
                stance on surveillance in their reporting.</p>

            <p>What does play a role? </p>

            <p>Several tendencies seem apparent, but are not a given.
                African-American legislators are systematically more likely to
                support surveillance reform. Legislators with a military
                background, or service on an intelligence committee, are
                systematically less likely to support surveillance reform.
                Legislators who identify with the Ron Paul movement, such as
                Reps. Massie and Amash and (of course) Sen. Rand Paul, tend
                strongly to support surveillance reform, and are a vocal and
                passionate minority of Republican legislators. More recently
                elected legislators of both parties tend to be more supportive
                of surveillance reform, probably because they have run first for
                their office during a period when the issue was especially
                salient. Legislators in leadership, and particularly on the
                Armed Services or Intelligence Committees, are more likely to
                oppose surveillance reform. Southern legislators are generally
                more opposed to surveillance reform - no Arkansas legislator
                rates above a D, and if an F- had been available, Sen. Tom
                Cotton (R-AR) would have been the only legislator with one.
                Pacific Northwest, Upper Midwest and Northeastern legislators
                are generally more favorable to surveillance reform - no Vermont
                legislator rates below an A. However, considerable variation
                within states is the norm, even in smaller states like Idaho and
                Iowa.</p>

            <p>We can see, therefore, that in key 2016 races around the country,
                the candidates running from both parties have sharply different
                positions on surveillance, and we have no reason to suppose that
                this will change in future cycles.</p>
